# What is a design system?

## Definition

According to the NN Groupd [definition](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-systems-101/) design system is:

> A design system is a complete set of standards intended to manage design at scale using reusable components and patterns

That means design system contains all the information and building blocks that is required to build an app with robust look and feel.

## Design system contents

Design system consist of following parts:

### Styleguide

Styleguide usually contain information about visual guidelines that gives information how apps and components are visually built:

> ðŸ‘‰ Fonts, colors, logos and other brand related material.

Styleguide can also describe what kind of language is used. ðŸ‘‰ `How we talk`

### Component library

> A design system without component library is just a brand book. No more, no less.
>
> <em> Anonymous</em>

Component library is a set of components that utilies the design that is described on styleguide and gives all the documentation that is needed to use them on your project.
Documentation includes:

- Information about the supported frameworks
- component visual examples
- code examples
- interface documention
- Information how to get or install the component

ðŸ‘‰ In this workshop we focus on this area.

### Pattern library

Pattern library explains how to use these components together to build applications. How to build different layouts and how different components should be grouped if used together.
Common pattern examples are how to build app navigation, how to build forms etc.
